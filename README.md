# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam - Off the Clock!, April 2022

## Theme
We used the theme of Time Crunch as a way to make clock based enemies and bosses that you beat up to escape the time crunch.

## Game Play
The objective of the game is meant to be to make it to the end of every level, and beat the God of Time who resides in the time demension. To beat the game before the Time Crunch count down you must jump, hit, and run through each level boss and mini-boss to make it through to the end! 

## Impediments
We ran into a bit of problem where the scenes for Levels 1 and 2 wouldn't open, and we redid the levels and fixed the issue.
## Implementation
Combat, a timer system
